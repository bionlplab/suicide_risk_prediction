There's a host of reasons in my past that have caused this, but now as I am near 40, the feeling of heavy loneliness isn't helping. I'm also not the type of person to reach out to anyone because I have in the past and it either had scared a friend too much, or burnt me. They're not trained to do so, so they shouldn't have to. I've seen therapist, but I'd always land in my cycle. Recently I was denied a promotion that made me really really question my self worth. I was fortunate to get recruited to another job that week which came with a substantial raise. Some other things happened in my personal life, and I was riding a wave of positivity. But at the same time, a little feeling of dread would appear and slowly grew. Until it finally made its presence. It would say things like: \\- \"things are going this well.... something's bound to get bad\" \\- \"You don't deserve these things in your life because you don't work as hard as others\" \\- \"You're gonna fail and everyone's going to find out you're a big fraud\" I've worked pretty hard to claw myself to where I am today, but why the fuck can't I be happy for myself. I feel even more guilt because people are having a hard time finding a job, etc, and I can't even appreciate something so lucky in my life. I just want to die. I feel like these are all temporary and in the grand scheme of things, I'm pretty irrelevant to the universe as well as others. It's 100% validation seeking, and I know this, but I feel guilty that I have it. Lately I've been giving nice meaningful gifts to various friends for their birthdays, childrens' birthdays, etc. I try to make things special for people so they feel elevated and good about themselves. I don't need anything in return either. I am just hoping that when I finally die, someone can remember me by looking at the item. Another stupid selfish attempt at validation and leaving \"a legacy\". I've been having a harder and harder time fighting the dip in mood, and at this point, I have no one I can talk to about it. Honestly if I didn't have my dog who relies on me, I would've killed myself last year. He was the reason why I took the noose off my neck that day. Sorry if this isn't a real problem. I feel like i'm just a whiny bitch that should be more appreciative of what I have..."

My exams will start around 5 months now and I am so fucking stressed that I can't concentrate anymore on my studies and nor on the things I like. I mean they expect us to score on the top even in this fucking pandemic. Almost half of my day is taken up on those bullshit online classes, they are about 3 hours long and after that I feel so fucking tired I can't do anything.

I've tried so hard to improve my studies, I'm really trying hard but nothing is working out. I'm sick of being a good, happy and a funny person because I'm sick of no one knowing how I feel. I know I do not deserve anything and I'm not worth it, because I'm a fat, faking piece of crap. I'm slowly pushing everyone away, because I can't put the burden of my life on any one of you, I have no motivation and drive to live. I feel so, so, so sad and alone all the time, no one will understand how much it hurts, the amount of pain is unbearable. If I told you, you'll hate me still. I hope that you feel peace when I'm gone, I'm not good enough, you deserved better. To my family, don't blame yourself or anyone, I'm sick, very, very sick of myself. I need to go away. I'm sorry for all the pain I've caused. I've always tried to give you all the best, I hope you reminisce on happy moments we had. You'll eventually move on and forget me."

I'm just as depressed as you are, but on the sappy, inspirational side of things, not everyone gets a childhood. It is a shitty fucking fact. A shitty, fucking fact. Having a childhood is a lot like like a Fallout perk. To gain it, you need to have satisfied the following (list is not all-inclusive)... -Had a loving, complete family that you were well-connected to. -Had a few good friends that you were regularly in contact with. -Had a stable, supportive household. -Been free of any mental illnesses (like autism and bipolar) that could reduce your quality of life. -Received plenty of positive enrichment. -Not been exposed to traumatizing events. ONLY after all of these conditions are met, will you get to say that you had a childhood. Having a childhood gives you a figurative bed of comfy memories to lie down on in times of reminscence and distress. Life gets really fucking hard when you don't have that. I honestly don't blame people who kill themselves over bad shit that happened in their \"childhoods.\" We are not immortals. We don't get so much fucking time that we can just overlook our past. We are running out time and gradually turning into irrelevant, graying old fucks in the process. Once your youth runs out, your mistakes are no longer forgiven. Someone fucking tell me I'm wrong. I dare them"

I'm scared that that's what people might think, so I haven't told anyone in real life. And to be honest, I don't even want people to understand. It feels superficial whenever anyone tries to be kind to me. I know it's ungrateful, but there's no other way to put it. I just wish everyone would leave me alone and stop paying any sort of attention to me. It all feels fake. They probably think that they're doing a good thing for me, but I hate it all. I don't want to feel better anymore. I can't see a future for myself anyways, so even if I ended up feeling better, I might just fall into the same depression again later on in life.

Bottom line: it didn't work. The therapists would just repeat everything they say at every second, then proceed to give me the most blank advices ever. I could tell that she was being nice, but it still felt like nothing but superficiality. Not to mention, my mum had to be contacted and be aware of this situation when I didn't want that. I clearly tried to get it through to them that I'd be uncomfortable with that. What did they do? Go ahead and tell her anyways, simply due to the fact that I am a minor. Of course, the actual contents of the session were confidential... But does it make things better? No. If I need help, I like to do so in a diligent manner that will least affect those around me. I can understand giving blank advices (it's a middle school therapy team, what could I expect), I can tolerate it being awkward in general, but going ahead and telling people when I'm quite clearly not okay with it? No thank you."

Tip-toeing the line between desperately needing affection and being repulsed by it. Some part of me intrinsically feels the need to stop existing. This suicidal trait nurtures the feeling of repulsion, indifferent to any potential emotional fulfilment. Something cracks in my brain, and suddenly all of the overwhelming chorus of emotions dissipate entirely, leaving me to float directionless through the void. Unbridled by feelings of guilt, regret or consideration, this is when I am most likely to let go completely. A weak tether keeps me planted on earth - a grasp becoming more and more tenuous as time goes by. It is approaching. The ultimate sleep. Deep in the recesses of my mind and in the pit of my stomach lay a fear of the unknown, likely nothingness not dissimilar to the time before birth. Not existing is so different once you have been. There remain ghosts of you in the minds of those who cared enough, and carbon left to rejoin the earth. It\u2019s time."

She is the person I have always admired most and love with all my heart. She is unequivocally my best friend, through and through, though I have not always been a good friend to her. Especially now when she needs it. She was diagnosed with Stage IV glioblastoma in December of last year - when we still weren\u2019t speaking after an argument a year earlier on my birthday. I found in January of this year when she called to tell me. It completely shattered my world, still nauseated me to think about and is despairing in the extreme. I cannot imagine what she has been through, after 3 craniotomies, several rounds of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation. Seeing her degrade before my eyes is traumatising, and my inexcusable instinct is to withdraw and avoid everything. Escape the reality by shutting down completely, which is what I have done. When she has needed me most in life, when she was deal the absolute worst of cosmic hands and needs physical, emotional and mental support - I was not there. I am an awful person, and as soon as she passes away, I will kill myself. There is genuinely no point continuing on with life if I cannot spend it with her, as we had always intended. We had so many plans that will never come to be. The pain is unbearable and she doesn\u2019t deserve it. I want to take it all away from her but I can\u2019t. Life is not worth living if she is not here to share it with, she\u2019s the love of my life and genuinely my soulmate. She\u2019s just everything. Love you P."

I told my phycolagist that I don't care about getting better and I know I'll kill myself one day. They didn't think my depression was 'that deep' obviously and now they said if I self harm again that they will put me in a mental hospital. I don't want to go back there. I told them I wouldn't but that's a lie. I will. I can't help it. They can't treat me like a prisoner. I didn't do anything wrong! I'm so scared and sad and pissed off. I don't want to go back to the hospital. Last time I went they forced me to tell them everything or else they would keep me in there for a week. I feel so betrayed. My phycologist told me that everything I told them would be between me and them but they lied. There going to tell the hospital and my mum. I can't do this. I thought I could trust them. I feel like I'm being attacked from all angles. I feel personally attacked. I can't trust anyone anymore. I need some advice or something. Just someone to tell me something. I feel so hopeless. I thought I could trust somebody only to get smacked back in the face for it. Everyone I truly trusted always hurts me. I feel so broken. Anyone had a similar experience?"

And on top of that a client escaped the unit on my hall. And I wasn\u2019t told how to react to that situation and my supervisor got pissed at me. Like you shitface I was the only one on my hall and I was changing the trash in the bathroom. The control station should\u2019ve saw or heard him leave and told me instead of me not seeing him in his room. Everyone just blames the new guy. Fuck."

I have work for the next four nights and I\u2019m exhausted. Gonna go get some more cbd. Hopefully the klonopin hasn\u2019t been doing anything weird with the cbd even though I\u2019m taking them separately. I should probably stop taking klonopin before I get addicted. My friend always talks about how much I suck while playing fortnite. Lol that sounds silly to say but I mean he\u2019s a good friend he just doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m dealing with.

X 100000000 Apparently injecting potassium chloride into your bloodstream is extremely painful so idk about that one. I\u2019m thinking about crashing my car on the way to work. Maybe into a tree without my seatbelt on. Someone please help me. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. Something is seriously wrong with me. They need to do tests on me or something cause somethings isn\u2019t right. What used to be anxiety feels completely different than it used to but the trigger is the same. It doesn\u2019t feel like anxiety anymore the anxiety feeling has completely gone away and been replaced by this hellish feeling and medication won\u2019t make it go away. I wish I could just get diagnosed with something already so I could know that something really is wrong with me and everyone would know that I really do have something very wrong with me. Whatever. It\u2019s not gonna happen. Gonna crash my car I guess. Where exactly idk. But I\u2019m sorry to my car."

Sometimes people can be bad for you, and just because toxic and abusive people come into your life that doesn't mean that every failed relationship (of any kind) is your fault. Sometimes, two people really aren't at fault. Sometimes, it's just one person. Don't be quick to tag yourself as that person. People can lie, and that includes your very own self, your very own mind. Depression loves to lie. It loves to deceive. It plants thoughts and ideas in our heads, and it's easier to just believe the negativity than it is to fight against it, but oftentimes, we criticize ourselves for not being able to fight off depression on our own. Would you expect one soldier alone to fight and win a World War? No, for it takes an army to fight a war. Don't expect those things of yourself either. You're only one person, and there's only so much that you can take on alone. It's important to open yourself up to others, even if they've hurt you in the past. Believe me, I understand how hard it is to keep putting yourself out there just to be hurt time and time again, but these experiences will teach you that you're stronger than you feel you are. You're still here, aren't you? You're still breathing, aren't you? Despite everything that you've been through, you're still doing the best that you can to get through the day, and honestly, that's more than enough. Keep trying. Keep getting through the day because there will be a day when you're no longer just \"getting through\" it; you'll be smiling through it, wishing the day never comes to an end. I promise that if you keep putting up a fight, if you keep reaching out for help, if you keep pushing past these seemingly impenetrable barriers, the reward that you will reap will be smiling and meaning it. You have a purpose. Your depression is lying to you. \u2764\ufe0f"

        "post_sequence": "DON'T GIVE UP. For the past 12 months, I have been wrestling with severe depression and PTSD - two oppressive and monstrous illnesses that consumed my every waking moment. I wanted desperately to die but was too afraid of what might happen upon committing such an act. I didn't want to commit suicide as much as I wanted to just \"stop existing\", if that makes sense, but the company that I kept made those thoughts and feelings worse and worse until I'd find myself sobbing for hours, contemplating suicide and wondering why I was cursed with being alive at all. Things were tough, to say the very least. Every living moment felt like agony, and I'd often sleep for many hours of the day to avoid being awake, when I knew I'd surely just sit in anguish and sorrow. My dreams became my escape, and it felt as though not a single soul on the Earth could help or understand me. Being in very emotionally abusive and manipulative relationships made things all the more difficult as well. Recently, though, I've been starting to feel better. Hope has finally begun blossoming in my heart again - something that hasn't happened for years now. I've been more confident in myself and have been trying new things, purely out of enjoyment and challenge. Just a month ago, if you told me that I'd be where I am now, I wouldn't have believed you. I would've insisted that I was destined for crippling depression and unimaginable mental anguish. I would've come up with every reason in the book to prove you wrong. I'd even make excuses for why things would surely never improve. But I made it here. I walked through Hell, several times, and made it back relatively unscathed, and God damnit, if my pessimistic, abused, unmotivated ass can do this, so can you. You're insanely strong just by reading this right now, by being ALIVE right now! Even though you can deny it all you want, I promise you that you are capable of pushing through these arduous and desolate times in your life because this is not all that life has to offer! This is not the end of your story, and no matter how hopeless you may feel, you can't deny the fact that you haven't experienced all of life's ups and downs yet; how will you ever truly know if it gets better if you never allow yourself to get there? Seek professional help, and I don't just mean \"go to therapy\" because not everyone benefits from it, although most do. Tell a psychiatrist or a doctor about your feelings and symptoms, and start on medications, if you haven't already! If you have, then talk to your medical professional about a stronger or different dosage! There are people who can and will help you through this, but you have to take that big first step of reaching out! Push yourself outside of your comfort zone because your life is not over; it's just merely beginning. \u2764\ufe0f Things do and will get better, despite how clich\u00e9 and stupid that shit sounds. Life is not meant to be a constant low; it shifts unpredictably, and nothing remains permanent for very long. You may feel as though the universe seems to hate you, and it may seem as though everything is futile and meaningless, but I know that neither of those things are the case. You have a purpose to fulfill in this world, and it's not to become another tragic statistic in a rapidly growing anual suicide chart. You are more valuable than a fucking number, more valuable than a fucking word, more valuable than any precious gem or glittering jewel. You are a human person that has beautiful traits and qualities: some of you are blessed with artistic talents, knowing your way perfectly around a brush or a pencil; some of you are gifted with logical and technical minds that put the mathematicians of yesterday's world to shame; some of you are comedic and outspoken, having a way with words that rival even the most infamous of authors; some of you are driven by justice with an unquenchable thirst for the end to corruptness; some of you are musicians with hands and voices that can perform every note as perfectly as your body breathes oxygen; some of you find pleasure in hard labor, working your muscles while serving the masses; some of you feel compelled to help others, to be a willing servant to those who need it most; some of you still haven't even gotten to a point in your life where you know exactly where you belong, and that's perfectly ok! It's ok to not know what your purpose is yet because the point is that you HAVE one. You have a purpose, whether you're aware of it or not, and once you discover your passions and your joys, you'll have an easier time answering that age-old question of \"What's the point?\" You'll know the point, but these things take time, and you'll never know the answer if you don't allow yourself to get there first. Depression fucking sucks, and feeling suicidal is the worst pain, in my opinion, that you can ever feel because you've reached your lowest mental state possible, but sorrow is not all that life has to offer. You will not be depressed forever because when have you ever heard of a storm that never stopped (on Earth)? When has the sun ever failed to rise up again after a long night? You will improve, if you seek the proper help and take the right steps towards the future, and, fuck, you will fall down again, and you'll certainly lose your way, but no matter how many times you stumble on your journey, no matter how many times you lose your footing or have to backtrack or can't decide which turn to take, you can ALWAYS be found again. You can ALWAYS find a way to keep moving forward because despite what your depressive thoughts want you to believe, there is still hope for you. There is still a chance for you, and I know for certain that you CAN get through this, even if it takes years. You have not seen all that life has to offer, my friend, and I can promise you that. Give life a chance, and give yourself the benefit of the doubt because you might just discover something that alters your viewpoint on life, and yourself, entirely, for the better. If anyone can do this, it's you. You are you, and that's a beautiful thing to be. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd0e\ud83d\udda4\ud83e\udd0d"

It plants thoughts and ideas in our heads, and it's easier to just believe the negativity than it is to fight against it, but oftentimes, we criticize ourselves for not being able to fight off depression on our own. Would you expect one soldier alone to fight and win a World War? No, for it takes an army to fight a war. Don't expect those things of yourself either.

I wanted desperately to die but was too afraid of what might happen upon committing such an act. I didn't want to commit suicide as much as I wanted to just \"stop existing\", if that makes sense, but the company that I kept made those thoughts and feelings worse and worse until I'd find myself sobbing for hours, contemplating suicide and wondering why I was cursed with being alive at all. Things were tough, to say the very least. Every living moment felt like agony, and I'd often sleep for many hours of the day to avoid being awake, when I knew I'd surely just sit in anguish and sorrow. My dreams became my escape, and it felt as though not a single soul on the Earth could help or understand me. Being in very emotionally abusive and manipulative relationships made things all the more difficult as well. Recently, though, I've been starting to feel better. Hope has finally begun blossoming in my heart again - something that hasn't happened for years now. I've been more confident in myself and have been trying new things, purely out of enjoyment and challenge. Just a month ago, if you told me that I'd be where I am now, I wouldn't have believed you. I would've insisted that I was destined for crippling depression and unimaginable mental anguish. I would've come up with every reason in the book to prove you wrong. I'd even make excuses for why things would surely never improve. But I made it here. I walked through Hell, several times, and made it back relatively unscathed, and God damnit, if my pessimistic, abused, unmotivated ass can do this, so can you. You're insanely strong just by reading this right now, by being ALIVE right now! Even though you can deny it all you want, I promise you that you are capable of pushing through these arduous and desolate times in your life because this is not all that life has to offer! This is not the end of your story, and no matter how hopeless you may feel, you can't deny the fact that you haven't experienced all of life's ups and downs yet; how will you ever truly know if it gets better if you never allow yourself to get there? Seek professional help, and I don't just mean \"go to therapy\" because not everyone benefits from it, although most do. Tell a psychiatrist or a doctor about your feelings and symptoms, and start on medications, if you haven't already! If you have, then talk to your medical professional about a stronger or different dosage!

It's ok to not know what your purpose is yet because the point is that you HAVE one. You have a purpose, whether you're aware of it or not, and once you discover your passions and your joys, you'll have an easier time answering that age-old question of \"What's the point?\" You'll know the point, but these things take time, and you'll never know the answer if you don't allow yourself to get there first. Depression fucking sucks, and feeling suicidal is the worst pain, in my opinion, that you can ever feel because you've reached your lowest mental state possible, but sorrow is not all that life has to offer.

Frankly, I'm appalled by some of the mean things I've been told, simply because I want to spread some positivity and love on a sub that's devoted to helping suicidal individuals. We should not be afraid to speak positively and kindly to each other. Stop spreading hatred around this community because you're doing literally everyone - including yourself - a disservice. If you're not here to receive support or to give support, then why even bother to be a jerk on a post that has nothing but good intentions? Like, what are you gaining?

I'm not saying that people should stop sharing their feelings or stories or anything; honestly, I think it's wonderful that people can post how they feel without the fear of being ridiculed for it, but what I am saying is that, along with those honest posts on people's feelings, those of us who are in good places should be posting more positive messages and resources for those who need it. We shouldn't be afraid of criticism from members who, for some reason, feel the need to shit on our genuine support. We shouldn't silence ourselves to accommodate the depression that others are feeling. We shouldn't be required to talk about \"positivity\" as if the mere mention of the word will get us banned from the sub. That's not why this sub exists!

I\u2019m going to university today. It\u2019s incredibly new and different. I\u2019m scared. But I know I need to do this, so I don\u2019t stagnate anymore, so I don\u2019t sit with my intrusive thoughts. Just know that you helped save this one, even in a small way. I haven\u2019t had the most support here, but I know there are people here who need help far more than I do, so I\u2019m happy with that. Please, keep fighting. Battles can be won in the smallest way. There\u2019s so much out there, I know it feels helpless, I feel helpless. But I want to try. Even if I fail, I can know I did what I could. I\u2019m wishing every single one of you the deepest happiness. Thank you."

Zero trauma and low bad history. I do have bad mood swings sometimes, half of the time im happy the other half im somewhat numb. There have been stretches of time maybe a month or 2 where ive been completely numb and lost most ability to function. I feel I disconnect. Due to this I\u2019ve been self harming for 3 or more years with no intention to stop. I cant talk to anybody but im curious whats wrong with me. Maybe its all in my head and self harm is just dragging me down. so my question for today for anybody with insight on the topic. Is self harm normal for individuals who have no mental health defects? sorry for wasting your time reading my rambling"

I feel the need to illustrate my thoughts and feelings in text anonymously. In the following paragraph I will summarize my past experiences and why I keep moving forward. I brought this among myself. It began in school, mentally I was fine with most aspects to spite my low self esteem dated back from early childhood which lingered. My close friends seemed to be loosing interest in the conversations I brought up and my hobbies. My clumsiness often brought people humour. And i was dying for adrenaline. I began with knife tricks which my peers seemed to enjoy for a brief moment. I noticed a good friend of mine had be self harming. I asked why. She told about about the relief that draws it, at first it was a puzzling thought and i decided to try it. Drawing blood for no other reason than curiosity. this will forever be my worst decision *With no effect which I had initially anticipated, put the boxcutter away and fell asleep. In the following week I experienced a sporadic panic attack which I quickly grabbed the blade and made a few marks again. It helped, from there (my memory is foggy) but I recite the audacity i had to think \u201cmaybe this lifestyle would be less boring\u201d its unclear if i just wanted to be an attention whore at the time but i kept doing self sabotage behaviour and depressing myself until I fell into a deeper hole where i relied on cutting to get through the day. I moved to the legs and cut shallow but quantity over quality. Some days in the triple digits. From this my self esteem plummeted and invasive thoughts flooded my brain not letting me tell anyone. Soon after suicidal thoughts became a daily reoccurrence, still today I feel invalidated and embarrassed from having done these things without any mental illness or proper reasoning. but I couldn\u2019t stop. Every little thing that i messed up became a reason why I deserve agony. An elephant in the room. My mood was confusing. One month i was highly productive but soon after went back into the dark struggling with basic tasks. I tried talking to close friends but they turned away. Not a topic they wanted to discuss. So i kept on going, going into a deeper hole from what I believe to only be bad self esteem. I kept quiet. My relationship ended because of it which lead me to styros to spite how i knew they weren\u2019t deep enough. And my suicide attempts not good enough Recovery. They bled for around a week due to poor medical materials and i decided to stop for 6 months. Every day i couldn\u2019t get it off of my mind. Suicide and self harm combined. It occurred to me that there is no end to the pain a simple mistake can lead someone to self hatred. I was still afraid to talk about it because i have no mental illness. My only reasoning was \u201cI deserved it\u201d and ended up relapsing I did not realize how permanently damaging, thoughts can be. I do not know what depression and anxiety feels like but i am so sorry to everyone who suffers from it. But i wish everyone recovery from suicidal thoughts and mental health. I apologize for the long paragraphs. Take care everyone, Stay safe -Nick"

I have no known mental illnesses and I'm not exactly sad. But I cant get my mind off death. I can't see me killing myself but I dream of smashing into a telephone pole. I wouldn't cry if today was my last and I never wear my seatbelt (just in case) I was curious if there was a name for it. I know I'm not suicidal, but I have terrible self esteem and a long history of selfharm from that. I don't know why I can't exactly be happy. but I think it's because I'll never be happy with myself. maybe this is called passively suicidal or maybe this is just normal. Id appreciate if anyone had thoughts or opinions on this. Thank you for your time. I can give more info if needed"

It might be because my brain is fucked from shitty meds I have to restrict because a fucking mental health centre ghosted me after making me addicted. I work very hard and very seriously all the time. I dedicate hours creating documents. I do not do it for myself at all. I do it to help my college mates. My work is not finished yet I just sent it to them with an edgy quote: \"in case I die before being able to complete it\". They were quite amused... Only I know I did not mean this as a joke haha. I am thinking about so many things right now. It hurts me quite a lot to know that I spent my childhood and overall life to the hands of online pedos. Posing for them, doing live shows for them. It started when I was 12 because my life at home was too violent, I was looking like a zombie, at school no student wants to befriend an ugly girl. I only lived online, for a very long time. I knew no affection, no touch and it went on for so long. I met my first meaningful friend when i started highschool. We were so close. Oh boy it felt like a slap to the face when I lost my best friend. I remember I sarted being healthier than I had ever been because I was just acting on automatic mode. I did not want anymore friends in real life. I did not want to talk, to share with anyone else so I pursued my life online. Still no affection, no touch. My best friend was not affectionate and touchy with me. Now what's bothering the hell out of me now, and I will type as if you could read it even if I know it is impossible (otherwise I would not have the balls to write all this). What have you done to me? I was already miserable enough. Why did you play on my lack of experience with affection to play the wolf in sheep disguise? Why did you give me my first \"holding hands\" experience in your fucking bloody apartment that you used as a piece of art? Why did you make me feel safe there? Why did you hold me? Why did you kiss me? Why did you call me over each time you knew I was wasted? Why did you touch me? Why did you take from me the only thing left I could have experienced happily? Why did you turn it into this nightmare? My first kiss, first time it got sexually physical in person at your apartment that was filled with your fucking blood. Every where. And you shitty \"psych\" music that made it sound like some kind of drug party. I can't even hate you for what you did. I just feel like an old piece of meat, like a child whose fairytail was destroyed right in front of her eyes. Despite being used to freaks, I was still naive. You have no clue all the hope I had left despite the childhood I had. All the love I felt despite everything I had already lost. I feel terrible, people, I feel terrible. I mean it when I say I have no clue if I won't die this week, if I won't just lose my shit, break down and give up. I've always be very resilient, very strong, I drag myself in the dirt, no hesitation. And I keep working hard to make sure that the day I finally take my own life, then I will have given enough to others not to make their lives too shitty. I live, I work, I stand, I take it all just for you and I have no regrets for doing so. I know I have been a jerk, an asshole, too rough, too cold, too absent. And I am so sorry I didn't know better, but through all of it, to online friends and family, there is no doubt I always loved you dearly."

I'm so unfit for this world while I really wish I could interact. But there is like a never breaking prison all around me and I cannot reach the outside world. Never. I just make everyone uncomfortable. I'm better off dead. you're all better off without me."

I've been suffering depression 3-4 years and it hasn't gone better at all, I'm all the time sad, angry or just tired all the time. I don't want to live at home I just want to get away from home all the time but there is nowhere for me to go. I'm suffering so many different pains like every other day my head just hurts badly and its not about lack of sleep or water. And there is alot of different pains which I can't do anything about it. All I want to do is sleep and dream that's all I want to do I just dont want to live at all. And when I do commit suicide I think there would really be noone that would care about it."

There's literally nothing for me to study, nothing I enjoy nor want to work towards.. I can't take a year off either to just think what I want to do.. And being myself is just awful aswell I'm always depressed, sad or just tired. I'm a very shy person I don't talk to girls nor have many friends which I hate.

I take advantage of them by not doing anything they ask me to, they only let me stay at the house because they don\u2019t want me to be homeless. I\u2019m tired of suffering, so I don\u2019t do anything I don\u2019t want to do unless it benefits me. I know that sounds wrong, but I\u2019m super stubborn. My mood is all over the place, I can\u2019t talk to my parents about my suicidal thoughts because they will always tell me it\u2019s because I don\u2019t do what they ask me to. Today I left a server because I was offended and was upset nobody responded to my vent but did to someone else that had posted afterwards. Someone in that server thought I had blocked everyone and came after me cussing at me and saying \u201cI\u2019m glad you were offended\u201d and blocking me after saying \u201cI don\u2019t like you after you\u2019ve shown your true colors\u201d without giving me a chance to explain. Well I\u2019m tired of being the bad guy. I just wish I could be someone who\u2019s better off alone. I don\u2019t have hope that things will get better, but at least I still have the will to live. I just want friends, a partner, a job I like, and to own animals one day. Every day that passes that seems more and more unlikely. Anyways though my heart goes out to people who are struggling worse or similar, please stay safe folks"

I sleep a lot and yet I'm still exhausted all the time. In a mental haze, fading away. Squandering years of education, drowning in student debt. My therapists are taking time off for the holidays. Everyone in my immediate family is dead. My friends are home for the holidays and I just left a bad relationship. I'm so fucking lonely and I feel so selfish for admitting it. I'm also feeling myself physically start to fade. I've stopped eating much at all. I used to be so scared of this sinking feeling, but I'm trying to embrace it like a warm blanket. There is nothing else. Thank you for listening... \u2764\ufe0f"

Never held a guys hand, hugged, kissed I've never even made contact with a guy before the only time was a accidental shoulder brush. I sound so lame and disgusting but i just feel so depressed. It's not like I'm purely looking for sex , i just want to simply hold someone's hand and feel loved and cared about. So many people have already had sex and kissed and i haven't done anything remotely close to that. No guy has even glanced at me or talked to me. I'm not attractive and I know that's the reason behind all of this. I have ash brown hair, blue eyes, pale skin, 5'3 and quite petite, which isn't attractive in this generation especially America. So many things about me make me very unattractive. I'm very shy and i don't know how to talk to people, which has made me quite friendless and made me appear weird to everyone. I'm not looking for the \"Your so young just wait until you're older\" I just wanted to write this to let it out."

After feeling like a burden for years I dropped out. I didn't see the point anymore and I'm now currently working a shitty minimum wage job.

You would have thought I was not of this world with how bad I was at conversation and normal human interactions. I still try my best and I'm doing okay I would say. When being locked away, I developed such mean characteristics I cannot even explain. I would watch people die on the internet almost everyday and enjoy it. It was almost evil but not. I would be incredibly rude and tell people to - go slit their wrists and kill themselves when I myself did it on the daily. It's unbelievably cruel I know. But I don't know why I do this and I wish I can just stop. I've developed extreme hatred for myself for my looks and personality that it's almost psychotic.

Really thinking about how actually meaningless my life is and how I've really set myself up for failure. I'm lazy and I've never done anything meaningful in my life. I never get out of my comfort zone. I have zero interest in friends or anything social beyond my sometimes online interactions which I force myself to make. Every day I think about suicide and how much better it would benefit my family and friends if I just simply didn't exist. I know they are disappointed in me and wish I turned out differently. It's harsh but I really don't care if anyone misses me, if they do at least which I really suspect they won't apart from one person. I don't care if anyone cries or is in pain from my absence. I've lacked empathy for the longest time and it's just how I am, unfortunately. I'm just a weird girl honestly. I hate sex, I hate friendships and relationships. All of that was ruined for me by myself alone. Something I have been thinking about recently is the cost it would take when I either fail my attempt or even succeed. If I fail it's going to give my family a large medical fee and if I die it's that and my funeral cost. I guess I do have some sort of empathy if I'm worried about that. I'm just at a point in my life where I'm unsure if I should keep torturing myself by living or finally let go no matter the repercussions."

It exhausts me so much. These dreams aren't even filled with monsters or anything typically terrifying. it's just me and my boyfriend. Me and my boyfriend of three years broke up and I went straight back to my old ways. I've been trying to eat again and gain my strength back so that when I go get groceries I don't fall over and get sick in the store due to malnutrition. But my body isn't the same anymore and I'm unable to get better. Maybe this is a sign that my life really is meaningless and done with. I feel like I'm rotting away in my bedroom everyday and nobody notices it. Not even the one I cared about most sees me breaking everyday. I don't even have the strength to harm myself anymore. everything is so tiring to me."

I heard puberty can give depression or something but this feels different. I\u2019ve thought about how life isn\u2019t worth it so much that it is actually how I feel about living now. I have some social anxiety and seeing my friends easily talk to girls and flirt and shit makes me jealous. I feel like a loser even though my friends like me. But sometimes I think they are really talking shit about me when I\u2019m not there. My brother is the only person who knows about how I feel, but only how I feel sad. I couldn\u2019t bear to tell anyone that I don\u2019t want to live. During some days I will just switch to a bad mood for the rest of the day. I stay up late and always say I\u2019m tired so I don\u2019t have to tell the truth. I\u2019ve thought about the least painful and easiest ways to kill myself but never looked it up because I probably won\u2019t get results. I\u2019ve even thought about suffering until I\u2019m old enough to buy a gun but I don\u2019t want to wait that long. I can\u2019t fathom even getting a job or learning to drive because I never knew what job I wanted or even wanted to grow up. It scares me thing about living without any of my immediate family even though I feel so distanced. There\u2019s a couple pocketknives in my house and I\u2019ve thought about using them but I\u2019m too scared of blood and pain. Tbh that and my mom are the only things keeping me alive at this point. My mom got me a knife for Xmas to protect myself but it sits next to my bed and I think about using all the time but I\u2019m scared. I\u2019ve thought about how I want to do it but I can\u2019t.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get that far. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m paranoid but the end seems so close. I feel like I\u2019m gonna die soon. I don\u2019t know how but I feel it. My life wasn\u2019t worth it. Only one girlfriend and some friends that don\u2019t check on me. If I died right now, no one except my family would notice. How sad is that? And I\u2019m alone for 8 hours anyway so I wouldn\u2019t be seen at all for that long. No one would be able to help me. To call the police or ambulance. I probably won\u2019t do it, but it would work. I hate that I feel this way when so many people have it way worse. Fucking embarrassing man. 15 years. Lasted 15 years before I broke down.

She will have these bouts where she becomes very affectionate with me and she constantly has me promise to her that I won't kill myself and I'll thrive. She's been doing this since I turned 20. It's not news to her that I want to die. I'm 21 and I'm pretty sure my end date will be once I turn 25. I tell her I will live on, but even I know that's a lie. Even if I decided to be crazy enough to try to thrive, I know that will only make the descent go faster. Life has been like falling in slow mo, there's no hero, no parachute, no grabbing onto anything; just me, the sky, and the ground. Nothing to do but wait. But now, I'm not staring at clouds become farther and farther from me, I've flipped over, and I'm watching the ground become closer."

The way she acted in response to that fight was so irrational and she did things on purpose to hurt me. It triggered suicidal thoughts that I buried for years upon years to come back with a raging vengeance. I called the suicidal hotline twice while she called my therapist to complain about me. She never knew I was contemplating suicide. These kids movies and tv shows I have watched so often because for ninety minutes, I feel like a kid again who has nothing to worry about, the kid who was depressed but too distracted to remember that I was. I feel like I have some of my innocence back. For ninety minutes I don't think about killing myself, using my eyebrow razor to scrap my ankles, or how much I dread waking up tomorrow. For ninety minutes, I don't care about anything accept for the world in my screen. I am aware, yes, but if a movie doesn't distract me enough, I'll pretend. Can you tell I'm desperate?"

Then I\u2019d wear a flowy dress and a flower crown. I would hire an escort to pretend like we were married from sun up to just before my death. All of my romantic firsts done in one day. We\u2019d have a picnic by the lake, I\u2019d buy them flowers. When we split ways, we\u2019ll say \u201csee you at home\u201d. After that, I\u2019d take some drugs I bought that would coax me into a soft but inevitable goodnight. I\u2019d wait for the effects to take, listening to \u201cClair de Lune\u201d because I\u2019m a basic bitch. I would then walk to the lake and let myself fall in. As I drown, I look up to see the distorted lights of the city and the night sky through the water until I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes open anymore. My life would have never known fulfillment and contentment until that day."

I am somewhat outgoing, so i can hide the pain. Noone has any idea that i am suffering. This is killing me, if it doesnt, i will. Kind words or directions dont faze me. I have tried finding answers on google, to no avail. I have only sunk deeper into self hatred/pity. People seem to victimize suicidal people. They seem to attack me, telling me why i, a free thinking individual, should not take MY own life. I am stuck going through the motions. Wake up early, Contemplate, Drag through the day, Get home, Contemplate, Play videogames, Contemplate, 'Me time', Contemplate, Listen to music, Contemplate, Fall asleep late. Repeat I am good at everything, but great at nothing. I can half-ass my way through honors classes. I have no sense of direction. My 'friends' hate me. My parents dont care enough to inquire. My self respect is gone. I once cared and tried. I have been raised on incentives, but they seem to have disappeared. I no longer care enough to try. I do things that drive me deeper into my crisis. I hang out with the druggies and those who dont care, as well. I have little to no social life, let alone a chance to have kids, which seems to be a major point in all if these '10 reasons not to kill yourself' lists. My dispair is unending. I see no end to my futile grind Grind grind grind, till the day i die, which i hope is soon. This is not a call for hope, This is not a plead for attention, But a post of my thoughts, Maybe my last Do not be suprised if you dont hear from me"

I have had multiple suicide attempts. I\u2019m a miserable and lonely person. I don\u2019t enjoy life. Every day I wake up and just feel upset because I don\u2019t want to be around for ANOTHER day. I\u2019ve opened up to people before, and they all act repulsed...disgusted. I\u2019ve been called a freak and a monster. People have told me I\u2019m a threat for society and I belong in a padded cell. Why? Because I\u2019m depressed. Because I\u2019ve tried to kill myself. No one understands mental health. They look at someone who\u2019s struggling and just think \u201cwhat a broken piece of shit\u201d. There is such a stigma against people with mental health struggles...as if we deserve nothing more than to be test subjects and to be locked up for the rest of our lives. They don\u2019t see the trauma, the pain, and the suffering of merely existing. They are incapable of understanding because they don\u2019t want to understand. They don\u2019t want to think about it because it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d. So many people have turned their backs on me...treated me like shit...told me to \u201cstay the fuck away\u201d. I\u2019ve wanted to kill myself for so long but suddenly now the perspective has changed a little bit. I don\u2019t want to just kill myself because I hate my life and am miserable, but also to spite the people who have treated me like shit. People don\u2019t give a shit until it\u2019s too late. I want to die and then maybe have all those people go \u201coh....he actually was struggling\u201d. \u201cMaybe I could have done something more\u201d. I want to hurt other people. I want them to feel guilt. I want them to suffer and pay the price of all the suffering they have caused me. From friends to colleagues to my own family members. They all don\u2019t give a shit about my well-being simply as long as I\u2019m alive. That\u2019s the bare standard. At the same time though... I know how little people don\u2019t care. I know my dad will just merrily skip away to the bank to cash out his life insurance check. I told him to raise my policy. He didn\u2019t ask why. He knows my previous suicide attempts. He did it with no hesitation. I\u2019m going to die and no one will bat an eye. I\u2019m serious too. I have no friends. No family. I\u2019m in so much pain and no one cares and it feels like death is the only way to ever convey how much I suffered. People only seem to care once you\u2019re gone. You only realize what you have when you don\u2019t have it anymore. So maybe (hopefully) my death will cause pain. Cause awareness for mental illness. That would be a dream. But also being realistic with myself, no one will care and if anyone\u2019s sad they\u2019ll move on with their lives. I already don\u2019t get any phone calls or texts. Never am I invited to family gatherings on the holidays...in fact I\u2019ve been told specifically not to go. I just want to die. I am ready to die. I am ready to fade into oblivion and leave this life forever and bathe in absolute darkness for the rest of eternity. Only then will I no longer feel this pain that I feel."

I have had multiple suicide attempts. I\u2019m a miserable and lonely person. I don\u2019t enjoy life. Every day I wake up and just feel upset because I don\u2019t want to be around for ANOTHER day. I\u2019ve opened up to people before, and they all act repulsed...disgusted. I\u2019ve been called a freak and a monster. People have told me I\u2019m a threat for society and I belong in a padded cell. Why? Because I\u2019m depressed. Because I\u2019ve tried to kill myself. No one understands mental health. They look at someone who\u2019s struggling and just think \u201cwhat a broken piece of shit\u201d. There is such a stigma against people with mental health struggles...as if we deserve nothing more than to be test subjects and to be locked up for the rest of our lives. They don\u2019t see the trauma, the pain, and the suffering of merely existing. They are incapable of understanding because they don\u2019t want to understand. They don\u2019t want to think about it because it\u2019s \u201chard\u201d. So many people have turned their backs on me...treated me like shit...told me to \u201cstay the fuck away\u201d.

Well, plans changed and my friend\u2019s wife\u2019s parents talked my friends wife out of it and used me as an excuse saying that I\u2019m not safe to be around because I went to the mental hospital in the past. They said I\u2019m dangerous and I\u2019ll end up killing everyone including the kid. They say that, and then say how my firiend isn\u2019t ready to buy a house, but then forces him on a loan application to buy a house with the in-laws. So now, I\u2019m not gonna have a home, my friend is locked in with his in-laws, his in-laws have taken total control of my friends marriage and now won\u2019t let me anywhere close to the house. Knowing this is how people feel about me (and multiple parties\u2014 at that) it just brings me down. Ever since I went to the mental hospital, I\u2019ve been treated like shit by so many people. I\u2019ve been called a monster, a demon, a threat to society. All because I couldn\u2019t handle my emotions anymore. I wish I could talk to my friends in-law to their face and tell them to tell me I should have killed back then. Honestly I believe it though. I should have just killed myself back then. It\u2019s evident the world would have been better off without me, since people are so annoyed by my existence. Jokes on them. I\u2019m gonna kill myself and make sure people know so they can celebrate my death. I hate this world, and here\u2019s another reason. The world has turned its back on me, and now I turn my back on the world. This is the end."

I am planning on killing myself this upcoming weekend as it\u2019ll be my first time home in the last 3 weeks and I can\u2019t keep going anymore. Today when driving though, most my thoughts were focused on death, suicide, and my methods/plans. Due to that though, I kept screwing up and missing turns, interchanges, and making careless mistakes. Our trucks have a lot of computers, so my dispatch called me and asked if I was alright and pointed out I\u2019m driving a lot sloppier than usual. I said I\u2019m alright and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m now at a truck stop. I still have 3 days of driving before I am home, but I\u2019m so overwhelmed and miserable. I don\u2019t know how I can last 3 more days in my current state. All that keeps me going is knowing I can shoot myself once I get home. What the fuck. I can barely hold my head up anymore."

Some people manage to beat depression, while others do not and usually succumb to it via suicide. I feel like I have watched myself slowly descend deeper and deeper into the pit of depression over many years of my life. At first it was manageable and I was still able to go about my life. Things got harder and harder and my depression grew and became more debilitating. My sense of identity diminishing as I became less of myself and more of just an embodiment of my own depression. Stage IV is the stage where it\u2019s hardest to overcome. Suicidal thoughts run rampant. The suicidal thoughts grow and keep growing and slowly become what your mind is fixated on. At this point in my life I know my fate will be suicide. I know this is what I\u2019ll succumb to. My mind cannot keep going, it cannot keep enduring. This cancer of depression has spread and taken over my head. Some people get lucky, I am not. Suicide is not a matter of if\u2014 but when. Soon people will realize how much pain I have been and continue to be in. But that will be too late. Such is life."

I'm a test monkey and you're the scientist, I'm the homeless guy, you're the one with healthy life taking minorities down. All of this is just an exaggeration but this is how I view it this is how it hurts me and angers me when I hear that. Everyone just care about themselves without realizing the effect it's causing to others that they think, assume they're ok and never ask. I wish I was blind enough to not have my eyes opened in realization this world it. It's a fucking decade in depression, suicidal thoughts are more consistent this year, every damn week it's making me crazy, and no one is able to help because they have way more important things to do. Lol money over your partner. Fuck humanity fuck myself I just really am filled with hatred I don't deserve to be alive I'm so toxic I'm never positive that's why I don't have friends that's why I'm losing them. I'm tired so tired ffs let me die. Why do I fear dead I should do it right away!!"

There is not one moment that goes by without me thinking of suicide. The only thing holding me back is my fear of death, and no thats not a good thing its getting worse by the second and i see no changes, people leave faster than they enter my life, they promise me they will listen to me but its not their fault. Im not the person they signed up for, i just scare them away. What the fuck is next? Exactly nothing, matter what happens im just too much of a destroyed man to enjoy anything anymore. I ruined myself, my life, my brain, my friendships, my relationships, my family, fighting to live while life is just a fight to who dies the classiest."

It doesn't help my mental illnesses, just mskes it even worse. Fuck your judgement, i didn't ask for it but it kills me on the inside. You're gonna need to learn to be alone. Well guess what im alone all the time, and i deserve some love too, i never hurt anyone I've forgiven all of my abusers i just want one friend to stick by. People around you love you. Well not when i feel like a burden to everyone, same fucking routine of having them see me have mentsl breakdowns and judge me for it snd beat me up for it. Your family will be sad. Why aren't they sad that I'm having mental fucking breakdowns everyday, why aren't they sad that my mental health has been fucking awful ever sice i was a kid and i was suicidal since then, why aren't they sad about me telling them to their face that i wsnt to commit suicide, i guess it doesn't matter. But life changes you just have to wait. No it doesn't, life changes when ur privileged enough to change it. For me snd many others i literally have no choice even if i wanted to, there are things known as terrorism and sexism and homophobia and racism going on all the time. Life doesn't only exist in the rich countries. Ur just lazy. I am, i am truly 100% lazy. I can't do shit and i dont claim to be able to do shit, thats why i want to die cus all of this don't even matter for me and it only burdens others around me Aren't you afraid of going to hell? I am very afraid of the afterlife and the possibility that it exists, however if god wants me to be happy wouldn't allow for me to live in a hell on earth, if he truly exists or cared, he would do something to fix it. But absolutely nothing changes at all. Im gonna hurt alot of people doing this but i would've died anyway due to my shitty mental health, i barely even carry myself around and i keep having mental breakdown to the point where i sm seen as a lunatic. I wish you all redemption and happines, take care of yourselfs snd your families."

Things won't change, they can't, its impossible life isnt some romantic movie where it all works out in the end. Nothing will ever work here and leaving isn't an option. Even if things do change my brain is a messed up piece of shit and I'll always be haunted by my past I'll never be happy. It's literally impossible my bipolar and anxiety will ruin everything. I got all the drugs i could need to do this and i got some guns not sure how its gonna go down but 3rd time's a charm. Im with my only friend left, most of my friend passed away from an overdose or commit suicide or got shot and the lucky ones left this country. He's leaving in a few days, we're doing a bunch of drugs and im gonna use this chance to end it all."

But then I can\u2019t help but think how nice it would feel it they still did. If they still wondered how your day was going and what you were up to. But I guess it\u2019s kind of pointless to think about that kind of stuff. I don\u2019t know why I feel this way. We were not even close for that long in comparison to my other friendships. But I really liked this person. I still think he is one of the funniest people I know. He can also be very kind and thoughtful, just not towards me anymore. He\u2019s charming and silly at the same time. Sometimes when I feel lonely I imagine myself being able to talk to him again. I imagine sitting next to him in that hallway and talking to him about whatever was on my mind, him listening intently. It hurts really bad when I think about how he\u2019s probably just getting on with his life while I\u2019ve been wandering around aimlessly trying to put myself back together. Sometimes I wonder if I really meant anything to him. I think that\u2019s just the worst, getting hung up on someone who could shrug me off as just an trivial part of their past year. Now I see him around and all I see is someone who wouldn\u2019t even look in my direction. Strangers, again."

Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like \"what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything\". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault."

God I have such bad luck, I've been sick for almost a year and it's getting worse and doctors don't believe shit i say (I have a liver parasite infection) my skin is always golden colored but not extremely noticeable to others due to me being dark skinned, my liver and spleen hurts, I can be cured with literally one pill but doctors think I'm a hypochondriac and it's impossible to get parasites. My mom is sick too. One doc thought my daily hives were from soap and laundry detergent. Another said my 20 point increase in liver enzymes within a few months are from obesity (I'm 240lbs, 6'1) Now I have a girlfriend and I just wanna get healthy again so I can actually safely work out and lose weight as I'm obese, which I kinda forced since I didn't wanna damage my nerves from malnutrition (parasites+eating less) I love her so much and want a future I just wanna be healthy again. I get lightheaded all the time, sometimes my liver will start hurting, sometimes I have to diahrhea before she comes over. I just want to be cured but docs won't listen I have every single symptom of a liver fluke infection. Hives for a year, liver flukes in my stool daily (I don't eat peppers or any sort of vegetable, I'm a pure carnivore and I eat cheese that's it. I just wanna end it all. Docs won't believe I'm sick despite evidence. One pill can fix it all. I don't care how much it costs, I'll pay anything to get healthy."

I've heard the speech over and over again. \"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.\" It sounds like a sensible statement, but when I feel like a worthless POS, it doesn't matter that the problem is temporary, I just want it to end. Yeah go ahead and say that committing suicide is stupid and only weak people do it. You're right; I am stupid and I am weak. I should just die. I know life isn't meant to be easy so stop telling me that. I really do not care. I know other people are going through much worse. Good for them that they're able to deal with it, but I fucking can't because I'm weak and I dont want to feel the way I feel. Its a never-ending battle where I'm always the loser. I wish it wasn't so hard to just end it all. I dont want to become a burden to my family. If I fuck up ending my life, I could just suffer as a vegetable for the rest of my life and be a burden to my parents who have already suffered and survived so much. I know that even if i am successful, everyone I leave behind will suffer but at least I won't be physically there to see it and I know that its very selfish. I will always be a disappointment to my parents and a failure to my younger autistic brother. Sometimes when it gets really bad, I think about just taking us all out altogether, but that would be too selfish and pathetic of me or maybe its not, but I rather not deprive them of the freedom to live or die. I dont have anyone to talk to. I've shut myself off from my friends for months now and I cant bring myself to be a burden to them by telling them my feelings. I dont want to get help because of my family's views on mental health. I dont want to get professional help out of fear they might call law enforcement and take me away and keep me in a psych ward. I dont want that on my record, especially since I'm a college student. I have talked to my counselor during my junior year when I had actually planned on escaping my house during the night to find a car to run me over. She asked if I made a plan to kill myself. My friend had already informed me since she was a student counselor that if I revealed harmful intentions towards myself or other people, they would call the authorities. So of course I said no. It felt good to have someone listen to my problems. And at the time, things did get better, but i dont know if I can wait anymore. I have made a lot of posts on this throwaway and I want to thank everyone who had responded and reached out to me, but idk how much longer I can fight my thoughts. I want to die but I know my reasons to end my life are stupid and I feel pathetic for feeling this way. How stupid does it sound when I write my note and say that I want to kill myself because I failed my driving test 3 times and can't meet the expectations of my parents. Ive tried my best to get their validation. Ive won awards and got into a prestigious university, but my whole life so far has felt like a streak of good luck with occasional bad ones. Maybe its just fucking karma and now I have to pay for all the stupid shit I've done. I dont know if I can survive university. I've heard of the rigor of the courses and the intense competition. I dont even think I deserved to be accepted. I've tried finding outlets such as religion, philosophy, books, activities that used to bring me joy in order to quell my thoughts but just failing to pass my driving test had completely dug a hole into my heart and now I feel my entire soul being painfully sucked into it. I feel so utterly worthless and pathetic. When I revealed my suicidal feelings to my mother during my sophomore year of high school, she asked me why I felt that way. What do I have to feel suicidal for? If I killed myself she told me she would do the same and torture me for eternity. Guess at the time it was enough to keep myself from acting on it, but now I'm not so sure. I dont know where my life is heading. I want to think my studies in university will help me find a meaningful career in the future, but now I just feel so uncertain. I want to embrace the uncertainty, but what I desire now is a feeling of security. I'm 18 so I'm an adult. I guess I am just realizing that I will no longer have the security I had when I was a child. My parents can't care for me forever, but I dont know how to get through with life. I wish I could just live peacefully in a secluded field and not have to worry about getting a job just to survive. I would just live off of nature and spend the rest of my life content with just that. I wish I didnt always have to seek validation from my parents. I know they love me but I hate it when I disappoint them and hear my dad berate me and call me stupid and hopeless. I feel a little better typing out my feelings on reddit. I even sometimes type out details that I never knew I thought about. I've never been diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness so I dont know if i really am depressed. I have suicidal thoughts from time to time and sometimes I almost want to act on them. Sometimes I think back on the instances where I almost wanted to carry them out and think about how pathetic I am. I have talked to people who have felt suicidal on the internet and never knew how to respond. I always think back on those instances and I feel so much guilt. I dont know what to say to them and now that I feel the same way, I dont think i deserve consolation. My feelings just keep going back and forth. I really really hate myself."

I know other people are going through worse shit than I am and I feel utterly stupid for feeling the way I do. I dont see the point in living because I dont understand what living means. What's the difference between living and just existing? I dont know and I no longer care to find out. If anyone has any other suggestions for an easy, clean, and painless way to die, please tell me. And no dont tell me that old age is the best way to die. I appreciate the effort but fuck off. I'm only going to send my note to a few close friends.

        "post_sequence": "I feel suicidal for stupid reasons and the only reason why I havent acted on it is because nature makes it so hard for me to die without fucking up and becoming a burden to everyone.. I've heard the speech over and over again. \"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.\" It sounds like a sensible statement, but when I feel like a worthless POS, it doesn't matter that the problem is temporary, I just want it to end. Yeah go ahead and say that committing suicide is stupid and only weak people do it. You're right; I am stupid and I am weak. I should just die. I know life isn't meant to be easy so stop telling me that. I really do not care. I know other people are going through much worse. Good for them that they're able to deal with it, but I fucking can't because I'm weak and I dont want to feel the way I feel. Its a never-ending battle where I'm always the loser. I wish it wasn't so hard to just end it all. I dont want to become a burden to my family. If I fuck up ending my life, I could just suffer as a vegetable for the rest of my life and be a burden to my parents who have already suffered and survived so much. I know that even if i am successful, everyone I leave behind will suffer but at least I won't be physically there to see it and I know that its very selfish. I will always be a disappointment to my parents and a failure to my younger autistic brother. Sometimes when it gets really bad, I think about just taking us all out altogether, but that would be too selfish and pathetic of me or maybe its not, but I rather not deprive them of the freedom to live or die. I dont have anyone to talk to. I've shut myself off from my friends for months now and I cant bring myself to be a burden to them by telling them my feelings. I dont want to get help because of my family's views on mental health. I dont want to get professional help out of fear they might call law enforcement and take me away and keep me in a psych ward. I dont want that on my record, especially since I'm a college student. I have talked to my counselor during my junior year when I had actually planned on escaping my house during the night to find a car to run me over. She asked if I made a plan to kill myself. My friend had already informed me since she was a student counselor that if I revealed harmful intentions towards myself or other people, they would call the authorities. So of course I said no. It felt good to have someone listen to my problems. And at the time, things did get better, but i dont know if I can wait anymore. I have made a lot of posts on this throwaway and I want to thank everyone who had responded and reached out to me, but idk how much longer I can fight my thoughts. I want to die but I know my reasons to end my life are stupid and I feel pathetic for feeling this way. How stupid does it sound when I write my note and say that I want to kill myself because I failed my driving test 3 times and can't meet the expectations of my parents. Ive tried my best to get their validation. Ive won awards and got into a prestigious university, but my whole life so far has felt like a streak of good luck with occasional bad ones. Maybe its just fucking karma and now I have to pay for all the stupid shit I've done. I dont know if I can survive university. I've heard of the rigor of the courses and the intense competition. I dont even think I deserved to be accepted. I've tried finding outlets such as religion, philosophy, books, activities that used to bring me joy in order to quell my thoughts but just failing to pass my driving test had completely dug a hole into my heart and now I feel my entire soul being painfully sucked into it. I feel so utterly worthless and pathetic. When I revealed my suicidal feelings to my mother during my sophomore year of high school, she asked me why I felt that way. What do I have to feel suicidal for? If I killed myself she told me she would do the same and torture me for eternity. Guess at the time it was enough to keep myself from acting on it, but now I'm not so sure. I dont know where my life is heading. I want to think my studies in university will help me find a meaningful career in the future, but now I just feel so uncertain. I want to embrace the uncertainty, but what I desire now is a feeling of security. I'm 18 so I'm an adult. I guess I am just realizing that I will no longer have the security I had when I was a child. My parents can't care for me forever, but I dont know how to get through with life. I wish I could just live peacefully in a secluded field and not have to worry about getting a job just to survive. I would just live off of nature and spend the rest of my life content with just that. I wish I didnt always have to seek validation from my parents. I know they love me but I hate it when I disappoint them and hear my dad berate me and call me stupid and hopeless. I feel a little better typing out my feelings on reddit. I even sometimes type out details that I never knew I thought about. I've never been diagnosed with depression or any other mental illness so I dont know if i really am depressed. I have suicidal thoughts from time to time and sometimes I almost want to act on them. Sometimes I think back on the instances where I almost wanted to carry them out and think about how pathetic I am. I have talked to people who have felt suicidal on the internet and never knew how to respond. I always think back on those instances and I feel so much guilt. I dont know what to say to them and now that I feel the same way, I dont think i deserve consolation. My feelings just keep going back and forth. I really really hate myself."

Yeah thanks for the talk. I know its fucking selfish and I dont care if its stupid. I already think I'm worthless so if i can't kill mhself I'll just mindlessly exist and wait for my inevitable end. Hope a car runs me over. It sucks even more that people are going through much worse than what I am going through but here I am wanting to off myself for stupid fucking reasons. I wish i could donate my life to someone who really wants it. It sucks the people who deserve to live have their lives taken away from them but the people who want to die have to continue enduring their pain. God it feels so fucking weird saying that."

I know they're in debt because of me and my reason for feeling suicidal in the first place is because I feel like a burden and a failure to them. I dont see how that's supposed to make me feel less suicidal. If i go through with my suicde there would be a chance that I fail. Most likely scenario is I become a vegetable and will become an even larger burden on my family. I probably won't have the ability to attempt suicide again and will just continue existing just to suffer. If i do nothing, I'll just keep going through this cycle of feeling okay then feeling super depressed"

She was the stereotypical \"failure\" of a teenager who used substances, ditched classes, and had poor grades. She was my partner for a few weeks. I really liked talking to her. I thought she was funny at times. There was a time when a narc came into our classroom and she panicked and asked me if she looked high. I didnt know what that meant so I said no. The narc went away anyway so she was safe. I was checking my grades on my phone one day and she looked over and commented on them. She asked me how I was able to do it and how she wished she could get good grades as well. I was ignorant at the time and just thought she didnt work hard enough but there were probably many reasons why she couldn't get As in school. Maybe it was due to her environment, her family situation, the influences that surrounded her. She was the kindest person I ever met. I respected her even though she fit the stereotypical Hispanic girl that my parents always talked smack about at home. Sometimes I wonder what it wouldve been like to have her life. She had a good relationship with her mother from what I've heard. Her mother cared for her and supported her. What would it have been like if I didnt obsess so much over grades. If my parents didn't push me to do well in school. If I could have access to Marijuana and use it as an escape from reality from time to time despite knowing it would impair my cognitive function. I'd like to think I would enjoy living a life not having to worry about living up to so many harsh expectations from my family and community. I dont know everything about her life. She must have probably had to deal with many unique problems of her own and maybe she still does. But I wonder if I would still feel the way I do right now if I hadn't been forced to obsess over grades and test scores so much. If I had supportive parents that would've respected my freedom and my choices. I spent so much time worrying about numbers, I dont even really know what I want in life anymore. I just spend my free time on the internet, sleeping, and thinking when my mind won't allow me to sleep. I feel trapped and I hate it."

Finally realized that being in a classroom was the only way I could escape my home environment. I cant fucking focus on my schoolwork and my depressive moods are starting to get in the fucking way of college. Ive been avoiding my friends entirely. I'm usually always the one to start the conversation and after realizing this, I really dont think they ever wanted to talk to me. I feel terrible for bitching about my first world problems. If Anne Frank could stay in an attic with her family for 2 years straight, why can't I. God I told myself I would kill myself before college started, but I decided to give it a chance. My first day of class was today and everyone was so fucking loud. I can only order the only mandatory textbook I need off the actual publishing house, but its out of state and they don't take credit card and I need the textbook by next week."

I was never allowed to leave the house. I was picked on by my relatives for stuttering when I was little. I was picked on for being shy because I was afraid of being judged by them. I still feel nervous talking to people older than me and feel intimidated by people who are super eccentric. Im an absolute wreck when it comes to socializing online and in-person. I dont know how to function as an adult now that I'm 18. I had been treated like a little kid my entire life and now my parents are asking me to grow up. I dont know what to do. I never felt so lonely before in my life. Ive drifted away from my HS friends and I've never had a good relationship with my parents. I depend on them so much but this is the first time I've ever felt helpless. I had confessed to my mom I was suicidal when I was a sophomore in HS, but she dismissed my feelings and told me if I killed myself, she would do the same and continue to torment me in the afterlife. I told both my mom and my dad I was suicidal again during my junior year and they told me not to mention it again. Ive cried several times in front of throughout my childhood and have always been told to suck it up. They told me I had nothing to be depressed about and I guess they're right. After all, they had been through so much more when they were younger in their country of origin. They managed to suck it up and give me a good life so why the fuck do I feel like killing myself? I got into a good college and thought they would be proud. I failed my driving test 3 times and my dad called me a disappointment. Called me retarded and told me he was going to give up on me and that I'm too stupid to function in the real world. Ive thought about jumping in front of a truck, carbon monoxide poisoning, hanging myself. Ive thought about calling the hotline but im afraid of them calling the cops on me and locking me up in a hospital and forcing my parents into debt. I wish there was an easy way for me to go.

I'm killing myself because I cant handle the consequences of my failure. I cant handle the judgment from my parents. Other people in this world are trying their best to power through after losing their jobs, their family members, their home, their belongings, and so much more worse shit than what Im feeling suicidal over. I wish I was mentally stronger. I wish I could continue holding back my emotions like my dad always told me to, but I just can't do it anymore. My dad will be disappointed in me if I killed myself. I thought this would help keep me going, but if I died, I wouldn't have to constantly be reminded that he thinks I'm a disappointment."

Literally everything people do will always involve money. Life-saving medical care? Be ready to go into debt for it. Mental health support? Let us tie you down to a bed and lock you inside a hospital and then chemically lobotomize you. Oh yeah, let's give you a reason to continue living: to pay back this gargantuan fucking bill. More ventilators for covid patients that we could easily mass produce with 3D printing? Nope, can't do that because of patent laws. Seriously you'd think a nation that prides itself in being \"the best\" wouldn't be so fucking cold-hearted to its people all the while sitting on other countries when they give more of a damn about their people than we do. Fucking hell."

        "post_sequence": "I really dislike how sensitive I am. One comment and I completely break down on the inside and the thoughts come back. I was compared to my neighbor's daughter a lot when I was younger. I guess my parents just thought it was an effective method of encouraging me to do better. While I did try to satisfy what they wanted in me, it never felt enough because they would keep doing it over and over again. It's like I had to always outperform the neighbor's kid or else they would just constantly compare me and berate me. It didn't help that she used to bully me and threaten me because her parents were our landlords and had more money than us. She did become a better person later on and is much kinder now. But I always still felt like I had to compete against her because I hated how condescending her parents were towards me. They used to call me stupid and retarded and they made sure to hint that what they were saying about me was true because my brother turned out to be severely autistic, which they thought meant that both of us were lesser humans. Fuck them because I got into a top college while their kid didn't. I feel really bad for her, though because I know she grew up with a lot of pressure from her parents too. I would hear shouting from her parents all the time and she received harsh punishments for not meeting their expectations. I thought I would now be immune to anymore comparisons from my parents and her parents. Unfortunately not. I still have yet to pass my driving test and I've failed 3 times now. I was berated by my father and he told me he would give up on me and that I was stupid and worthless. It's like my admission to a top college no longer meant anything to him. Today I found out the neighbor's daughter passed her test on her first try and she even began driving lessons later than I did. Now all those negative thoughts are coming back. I havent felt such a hard blow to my self-esteem in a really long time. All of those memories are coming back and are living in my mind rent-free. I have a quiz, exam, and essay all due next week and I am just feeling so overwhelmed. I want to prove them wrong but with everything that's happening right now, I just feel so hopeless. I feel so stupid for letting their comparison get to me again. I hate being so weak-minded. I truly don't believe I deserve to get into the college I am currently enrolled in. Everyone here is so much more charismatic and intelligent than I am. I dont know what they saw in me and I feel foolish for believing I had a chance at succeeding in this school and in this life. I've been thinking about killing myself for a while and I even attempted to hang myself with my jump rope, but it was too weak and I chickened out. It feels so much more different thinking about suicide now because I know if I do end up succeeding, everyone will remember me as the pathetic girl who killed herself over her failed driving test. I used to think that those opinions won't matter once I'm dead, but the thought of that being my legacy just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. I just feel at a crossroads right now and I dont know what to do. It feels so stupid to be suicidal over something as trivial as failing a driving test when other people around the world are going through much worse. I dont deserve to feel this way and I have no right to. I just wish I didnt give a fuck about what they thought but I was raised to be so dependent on my parents that I cant even function in the real world.

It's like every cell of my body is finally realizing that my current happiness will eventually go away and I'll fall back into a deep depressive mood. I thought focusing on my school work would help take my mind off of my suicidal thoughts, but it seems that it isn't working anymore. Theres no point in trying to fight a losing battle. This is it. I dont have anywhere else to head towards to."

I was compared to my neighbor's daughter a lot when I was younger. I guess my parents just thought it was an effective method of encouraging me to do better. While I did try to satisfy what they wanted in me, it never felt enough because they would keep doing it over and over again. It's like I had to always outperform the neighbor's kid or else they would just constantly compare me and berate me. It didn't help that she used to bully me and threaten me because her parents were our landlords and had more money than us. She did become a better person later on and is much kinder now. But I always still felt like I had to compete against her because I hated how condescending her parents were towards me. They used to call me stupid and retarded and they made sure to hint that what they were saying about me was true because my brother turned out to be severely autistic, which they thought meant that both of us were lesser humans. Fuck them because I got into a top college while their kid didn't. I feel really bad for her, though because I know she grew up with a lot of pressure from her parents too. I would hear shouting from her parents all the time and she received harsh punishments for not meeting their expectations. I thought I would now be immune to anymore comparisons from my parents and her parents. Unfortunately not. I still have yet to pass my driving test and I've failed 3 times now. I was berated by my father and he told me he would give up on me and that I was stupid and worthless. It's like my admission to a top college no longer meant anything to him. Today I found out the neighbor's daughter passed her test on her first try and she even began driving lessons later than I did. Now all those negative thoughts are coming back. I havent felt such a hard blow to my self-esteem in a really long time. All of those memories are coming back and are living in my mind rent-free. I have a quiz, exam, and essay all due next week and I am just feeling so overwhelmed. I want to prove them wrong but with everything that's happening right now, I just feel so hopeless. I feel so stupid for letting their comparison get to me again. I hate being so weak-minded. I truly don't believe I deserve to get into the college I am currently enrolled in. Everyone here is so much more charismatic and intelligent than I am. I dont know what they saw in me and I feel foolish for believing I had a chance at succeeding in this school and in this life. I've been thinking about killing myself for a while and I even attempted to hang myself with my jump rope, but it was too weak and I chickened out. It feels so much more different thinking about suicide now because I know if I do end up succeeding, everyone will remember me as the pathetic girl who killed herself over her failed driving test. I used to think that those opinions won't matter once I'm dead, but the thought of that being my legacy just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth. I just feel at a crossroads right now and I dont know what to do. It feels so stupid to be suicidal over something as trivial as failing a driving test when other people around the world are going through much worse. I dont deserve to feel this way and I have no right to. I just wish I didnt give a fuck about what they thought but I was raised to be so dependent on my parents that I cant even function in the real world.

What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived? I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying \"taking my life\" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. \"Think about the pain you will cause us.\" \"Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else.\" It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was \"the least I could do for my friends and family.\" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. \"I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me.\" (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness.

It feels like a cage i built around me that i cant brake no matter what."

I was out with friends and me other two friends (a,b) were wating on a bridge waiting for a third friends. So me and one of my friends (a) were sitting on the stairs facing away from the bridge. We didn't notice that our friend (b) climbed the guard rail and was just sitting on the edge. Now when we (me and a) noticed what she (b) was doing, i didn't feel anything, i expected to feel my heart to drop but nothing. Now obviously the friend (a) that was sitting next to me jumped and started running towards her. In that moment i understand that i don't feel anything, i could watch someone that i know die in front of my eyes and i will feel nothing. Honestly if it was just me and my friend (b), i would probably just join her. (No one was harmed)"
